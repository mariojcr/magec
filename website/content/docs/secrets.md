Secrets let you store sensitive values — API keys, tokens, passwords — in the Admin UI and reference them anywhere in your configuration with `${KEY}` syntax. No more hardcoding credentials or juggling environment variables across deployments.

## Creating a secret

Open the Admin UI, click **Secrets** in the sidebar, then **+ New Secret**.

{{< screenshot src="img/screenshots/admin-secrets.png" alt="Secrets list showing one existing secret" >}}

Fill in the form:

{{< screenshot src="img/screenshots/admin-secret-dialog.png" alt="New Secret dialog with fields for name, key, value, and description" >}}

| Field | What to enter | Example |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| **Name** | A human-readable label | `OpenAI API Key` |
| **Environment Variable Key** | The key you'll reference with `${...}`. Must be `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`. | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| **Value** | The actual sensitive value. Once saved, it's never shown again. | `sk-...` |
| **Description** | Optional note for yourself | `Production key for GPT-4o` |

Click **Save**. The secret is ready to use immediately.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
Secret values are **write-only**. After saving, the value is never displayed again — not in the UI, not in the API. When editing a secret, leave the value field empty to keep the current value, or enter a new one to replace it.
{{< /callout >}}

## Using secrets in your configuration

Once created, reference a secret anywhere by wrapping its key in `${...}`. For example, when configuring a backend:

{{< screenshot src="img/screenshots/admin-secret-usage.png" alt="Memory provider using ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD} in the connection string" >}}

Here the connection string uses `${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}` — Magec replaces it with the actual secret value at runtime.

### Where you can use `${KEY}`

Secrets work in every resource field:

| Resource | Example field | Example value |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| **Backends** | API Key | `${OPENAI_API_KEY}` |
| **Backends** | Base URL | `${OPENAI_BASE_URL:-https://api.openai.com/v1}` |
| **Memory** | Connection String | `redis://${REDIS_PASSWORD}@redis:6379` |
| **MCP Servers** | Environment | `GITHUB_TOKEN: ${GITHUB_TOKEN}` |
| **Clients** | Token | `${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}` |

The `${VAR:-default}` syntax is also supported — if the variable is unset or empty, the default value after `:-` is used instead.

## How it works under the hood

When Magec starts, all secrets are injected as environment variables. Then every `${VAR}` reference in the store is expanded. This means secrets and regular environment variables (from Docker, Kubernetes, systemd) all work the same way.

If you need to understand the expansion pipeline, encryption details, external env var compatibility, or recovery procedures, see [Advanced Secrets](/docs/secrets-advanced/).

## Encryption

When an [admin password](/docs/admin-password/) is configured, all secret values are encrypted on disk using AES-256-GCM. Without an admin password, secrets are stored in plain text — a warning is logged to remind you to enable it.

See [Advanced Secrets — Encryption at rest](/docs/secrets-advanced/#encryption-at-rest) for the full technical details.
